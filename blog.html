                                            Learning a new programming language could prove difficult if one starts from scratch or without any resources. As such one should always look for 
                                            external resources that would help one in learning a new programming language.
                                            <p>
                                                There are various websites online that aid in learning a new language. Some examples include: Stack Overflow, GeeksforGeeks and as such.
                                                Wise utilisation of such websites can provide a valuable key to learning and understanding programming languages.
                                            </p>
                                                Several languages have easier learning curves than others. Some of the easier programming 
                                                languages to learn include Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C#. 
                                            <p>
                                                
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                               As there are easier languages to learn there are also tougher ones to learn. Some of them include C++, Lisp(List Processing), Prolog and such. These provide difficult
                                               due to complex syntax and age of the language itself such as LISP one of the most oldest programming languages after FORTRAN(formula translator).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In general learning a programming language will depend on the learner and the difficulty of the
                                                language itself. However with the aid of various online tools and videos this can be made much maiores
                                                easier.

                                                Several improvements have been made upon the upgrades from the PlayStation 4 which has made their console the one to beat in the

                                                <h5>Joysticks</h5>
                                               The Joysticks lie core to console gaming and as such Sony has well and truly improved upon previous Joysticks and might have 
                                               actually radically improved so to speak the Joysticks and set new standards. These new Joysticks now offer haptic feedbacks according to
                                               what the player does in game, offer different vibrations to different instances and more ergonomic feel to the hands when handled.
                                               These new Joysticks don't only feel good but look good with the new design Sony decided to take. If one peers close one can pickout small
                                               etching upon the grips of the Joysticks.

                                                <h5>Game Exclusivity</h5>
                                                <p>Game Exclusivity has always been Sony's edge over most consoles, and now more than anytime ever this holds true.
                                                    True to their words Sony via BluePoint Games published a remaster of the acclaimed 2009 classic "Demon's Souls" as a launch title for
                                                    the console. Another huge launch title was the Spider Man game: "Spider Man Miles Morales". Sony's PlayStation 5 will also be having improved versions of 
                                                    their predecessor's PlayStation 4 exclusives. Critically acclaimed PS4 releases such as "the Last of Us", "Ghost of Tsushima", "Uncharted 4 A Thief's End", and 
                                                    "Shadow of the Colossus", "Bloodborne" and the like.
