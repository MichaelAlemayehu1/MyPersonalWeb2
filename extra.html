                        I love to learn and I continually seek to understand the world I live in. 
                        I like subjects such as history, programming and physics(but not Mechanics), particularily 
                        Atomic Physics. My interest in programming came from my love for video games. I would love to 
                        develop a game from the knowledge I am currently acquiring <a href="extra.html" target="_blank" title="yeet">

                                    I spend most of my time watching Movies, TV shows, Football Matches and YouTube and playing Video Games. 
                                    One of my favorite movies is <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/?ref_fn_al_tt_2"><b>The Shawshank Redemption</b></a>.
                                    TV show genres that I like include sitcoms, satirical animations and fantasies. Mostly on YouTube I watch
                                    commentary channels, sports highlights, video game walkthroughs and art channels. Video Games is included in the

                                    at a game in my highschool match. I currently hold the most clean sheets in a football tournament. 
                                    I have played basketball in highschool. <br>
                                    I have experiences in programming languages such as python and java. I would say I am a novice
                                    programmer. I took part in two projects over the last two semesters involving the aforementioned languages.
                                   I am an experienced Video Game player and a "certified" Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 LAN expert.

                        Video games can also have types such as First Person Shooters, Third Person Shooters, Indie games, Dystopian games, Role Playing Games and such.

                            Video games that I have played, have all been pirated. There are various piracy websites for video games. To name a few
                            Ocean of Games, Ova games, and torrent sites such as 1337x and the Pirate Bay.

                            Football games to Basketball games. Full on first person shooters to quiet open world role playing adventure games.
                            Some of the games I have played from each genre include, FIFA 14, Winning Eleven 8 International from football,
                            NBA 2k14 and 2k14 from basketball, Call of Duty series from first person shooters and Far Cry from action adventure role playing games, and The Witcher series from role playing adventures genre.

                            Multiplayer games have grown side by side with the development of the Internet and Networking.
                            Two online games that have dominated over the past couple of years are Minecraft and Fortnite.
                            The former had existed since 2011 but gained lot of surface with the development of social media platforms such as Reddit and YouTube.
                            Famous YouTubers like PewDiePie have gotten the game a lot of attraction. Reddit contributed to its fame through memes primarily. The latter, Fortnite, is an online only Battle Royale game that exploded in 2018 which gave rise to famous 
                            live streamer Tyler "Ninja" Blevins. Carrying with it Twitch, a live streaming platform, Fortnite continued to expand
                            popularizing various dance moves such as the "floss", the "dab" and "take the L". Fortnite popularity has decreased recently but the game has without no doubt a genre 
                            defining multiplayer game.

                            One of my favorite video games I have ever played is Dishonored. Dishonored is a Dystopian, RPG, exploration game made by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda.
                            The game takes place in the fictional city of Dunwall where a rat plague has devastated its citizens. The game starts off with the character the player controls, Corvo Attano, returns to the royal palace.
                            There he meets the Empress Jessamine Kaldwin and her child Emily Kaldwin. A group of magical assassins led by Daud however interrupt their meeting and assassinate the empress kidnapping the child. Corvo is framed for murder and set for a death sentence
                            where he is helped escape prison. The game follows the journey of Corvo making a series of assassinations, saving Emily and restoring order.
